This program will scan multiple text files and count the number of occurrences of each word in those files. A binary tree will be used to keep track of all the words and their counts. When all input files have been scanned, the program will print the words and counts to a text file. It will also print the most common and least common words to the terminal

To compile the program, run the command:
gcc -Wall count_words.c binaryTree.c -o binaryTree.exe

To run the program, run the command:
./countWords input_data1.txt input_data2.txt
